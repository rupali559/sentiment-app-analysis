## Project Overview

- Frontend: A webpage with a text box, an "Analyze" button, and a result area.
- Backend: A Flask API that uses **TextBlob** (a pre-trained sentiment analysis model) to calculate sentiment.
- Deployment: Backend hosted on **Render**, frontend hosted on render using static website

##  Features

- Text input box for users to type/paste text.
- Analyze button to trigger sentiment analysis.

2. **Backend (Flask API)**:
   - Receives the text at the `/analyze` endpoint.
   - Uses TextBlob to calculate sentiment polarity:
     - Polarity > +0.1 â†’ Positive
     - Polarity < -0.1 â†’ Negative
     - Otherwise â†’ Neutral
   - Returns the result as JSON:  
     ```json
     { "sentiment": "Positive" }
     ```
